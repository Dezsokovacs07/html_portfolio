<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
    Hello! My name is Dezső Kovács, and I am a passionate web development enthusiast who embarked on this exciting journey just one month ago. I reside in a cozy house where I enjoy the company of my beloved pets, reflecting my love for animals. When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in the world of football, cheering for my favorite teams. My recent foray into web development has been incredibly rewarding, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field. Combining my creativity and technical skills, I am excited to create engaging and functional web experiences. Thank you for joining me on this adventure!</p>
